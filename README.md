# SheHacks2022
SheHacks 6 Hackathon on January 7, 2022. 
Team Members: Claire McGuigan, Kaitlyn Moore, Lauren Whitemore and Tara Lee

## Inspiration
As four, busy, software engineering students at Western University, this semester we've had to experience living on our own and dealing with all the tasks that come with it, such as cleaning, food shopping and expenses. Having to deal with so many deadlines and constant tests, we ran into difficulty keeping our lives organized while keeping up with our academics. Together we decided to build a website that could help keep students or any other individuals that live together, keep their lives organized by creating "CoLiving," a website that allows individuals to keep track of your expenses, grocery lists and weekly chore assignments, to alievate the stress and frustration that can arise when living with others.

##Process
After deciding on our project idea, we set off to work by deciding on the site's key features and distributing the tasks. We decided to build a website to leverage our HTML, CSS and JS skillsets. Each of us worked on an individual webpage, while communicating throughout the weekend to work through problems and keep each other updated. SheHacks6 was an awesome learning experience for us all, and truly put our fullstack skills to the test!
